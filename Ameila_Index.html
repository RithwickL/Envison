            <p>Facing the challenges to get the assistance needed for the university's application is an exhausting
                experience for most of us. From feeling lost when school counselors aren’t able to provide the accurate
                guidance about university applications, to keeping track of crucial deadlines, and even planning out the
                entire journey on your own—these hurdles can be isolating and intimidating.

                These challenges struck a chord with us and inspired action. We’ve felt the weight of pursuing ambitious
                dreams with limited resources and know firsthand how challenging it is to navigate the path to a new
                life in the United States.

                That is where Envision comes in. Our diversified team, with members from vastly different backgrounds
                and experiences, united with a single goal: to create a revolutionary initiative that offers inclusive,
                free support that is designed especially for youngsters with limited financial resources who can't
                afford expensive counselors. Envision is more than just a website for finding the right guidance; it's
                an aspirational community which integrates students applying to different universities, enabling them to
                connect, share their experiences, seek help, and receive guidance throughout the entire application
                process while feeling welcomed and giving everyone a fair chance to flourish in a world that often seems
                unfair.
